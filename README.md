# MongoDB & Mongoose

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#mongodb-and-mongoose

# Intro

**MongoDB** is a database application that stores JSON documents (or records) than you can use in your application.  
Unlike SQL, another type of database, MongoDB is a non-relational or "NoSQL" database.  
This means MongoDB stores all associated data within one record, instead of storing it across many preset tables.  

**Mongoose** is a popular npm package for interacting with MongoDB.  
With Mongoose, you can use plain JavaScript objects instead of JSON, which makes it easier to work with MongoDB.  
Also, it allows you to create **blueprints** for your documents called **schemas**, so you don't accidentally save the wrong type of data.
